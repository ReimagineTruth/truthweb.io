# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At **Reimagine Truth Organization** and **TruthWeb**, we take the security of our projects very seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps to report it to us:

1. **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been reviewed and addressed.
2. Send a detailed report about the vulnerability, including how it can be reproduced, any potential risks, and any suggestions for fixing it. Please send your report to us at:

   - Email: [security@truthweb.com]
   - Telegram: [TruthWeb Security Channel Link]
   - GitHub Issues: [Link to Security Issue Template]

3. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
4. A security team member will investigate and determine the impact of the vulnerability. We will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and release a patch or mitigation.
5. Once the issue has been addressed, we will notify you and provide information about the fix or patch.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices to protect both users and the integrity of the project. By following the process above, you help ensure that vulnerabilities are resolved privately and effectively before they are made public.

## Security Updates

We recommend subscribing to the project's repository or official communication channels (Telegram, GitHub, etc.) to receive updates about security patches and other important security-related information.

## Acknowledgments

We thank everyone who helps us keep the project secure. If you contribute to resolving a security issue, we will acknowledge your contribution in our security changelog, unless you request otherwise.

## Secure Development Practices

We follow secure development practices and regularly audit our codebase for vulnerabilities. We encourage contributors to use the following best practices when submitting code:

- Ensure that any third-party libraries used are regularly updated and free of known vulnerabilities.
- Always validate inputs and sanitize user data to prevent injection attacks.
- Perform security testing and audits for any new features or code changes.
